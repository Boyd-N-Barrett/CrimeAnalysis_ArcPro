<h1>Crime Analysis (ESRI Training Module)


<h2>Description</h2>
This was part the Crime Analysis Solution: Tactical and Strategic Analysis web course offered by ESRI. I completed the module in August 2024<br/>
<br/>
This training module included a variety of mapping and analytical techniques, including optimized hot spot analysis, emerging hot spot analysis, 80-20 Analysis, summarize Incident Count, and other tools that are used to uncover trends and patterns in crime data.<br/>
<br/>
Repeat and near repeat analysis tools form a specialized category within the Crime Analysis suite, designed to predict and prevent crime through the study of past incidents. Utilizing theories of repeat victimization and predictive mapping, these tools in ArcGIS Pro aid law enforcement in deploying resources more effectively. They identify patterns of crime in specific areas and time frames, allowing for the creation of prediction zones for proactive measures. Unlike other analytical methods, these tools uniquely factor in the element of time, offering a dynamic approach to anticipating criminal activity. 

<h2>Environments Used </h2>
